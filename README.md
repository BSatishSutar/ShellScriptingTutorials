# Shell Script Repository

Welcome to my shell script repository! This repository is dedicated to sharing my knowledge and learning about shell scripting. 

## Getting Started

To get started with shell scripting, you'll need to have a terminal or command prompt installed on your computer. If you're using a Mac or Linux computer, you can use the built-in terminal. If you're using Windows, you can use PowerShell or Git Bash.

Once you have a terminal or command prompt installed, you can start writing shell scripts. Here are some resources to help you get started:

- [Shell Scripting Tutorial](https://www.shellscript.sh/)
- [Bash Scripting Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/shell_scripting.htm)
- [Learn Shell](https://www.learnshell.org/)
